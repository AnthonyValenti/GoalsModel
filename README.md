# Expected Goals Model

Using NHL shot data dating back to 2016 I created a logistic regression model to predict if any given shot will result in a goal or not. The dataset contains over 100 features and was downloaded from Moneypuck.com .

This graph dispalys my models predictions for the top 30 goal scorers in the 2022-2023 NHL season and compares it against their actual goal count as well as other publical models.

My model was able to more accurately predict goals from the top 30 goals scoeres in the 2022-2023 when compared against the most popular public models.
